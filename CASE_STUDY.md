**EBHCS Advisor Bulletin Board ‚Äî Case Study**

- Project: EBHCS Advisor Bulletin Board
- Stakeholders: ESOL/HSE Advising Team, Program Director, 350+ students
- Tech: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage), HTML/CSS/JS

**Overview**
- Problem: Advisors were duplicating announcements across multiple Google Classrooms, fragmenting communication and increasing workload. Students lacked a single, reliable place to find up‚Äëto‚Äëdate opportunities and announcements.
- Goal: Provide a centralized, school‚Äëwide bulletin where advisors can post once and reach all 350+ students, with simple publishing, strong filtering, and a great mobile experience.
- Outcome: A live, web‚Äëbased bulletin with an Advisor Portal (post/manage) and a Student View (gallery and calendar), backed by Firebase for secure auth, real‚Äëtime updates, and durable storage.

**Objectives**
- Centralize: One posting reaches all students/programs.
- Reduce friction: Make posting as easy as filling a form and clicking ‚ÄúPost.‚Äù
- Improve discovery: Multi‚Äëselect filters, search, and calendar view to quickly find relevant items.
- Govern access: Only EBHCS advisors can create/manage posts; the public can read active posts.
- Handle artifacts: Support images and PDFs for flyers, forms, and details.

**Solution**
- Student View (index):
  - Gallery grid with category badges, images, links, contact, and deadline cues.
  - Calendar view to visualize time‚Äëbound items; per‚Äëday modal lists all events.
  - Search + multi‚Äëselect filter chips (Category, Deadlines, Posted Date, Class Type, Posted By).
  - Expired logic: automatic ‚ÄúEXPIRED‚Äù banners and toggle to include/hide.
- Advisor Portal (admin):
  - Guided form with required/recommended sections; preview before posting.
  - PDF upload and image upload with size validation and previews.
  - Manage Posts tab: search, sort (newest/oldest/category/deadline), filter (active/expired), and edit/update.
  - Authentication with advisor accounts; first‚Äëlogin password change flow.

**Key Features Implemented**
- PDF uploads up to 10MB with student‚Äëside ‚ÄúüìÑ View PDF‚Äù (admin.html, firebase-config.js, style.css).
- Multi‚Äëselect, color‚Äëcoordinated filters for categories/deadlines/class types/posted by (index.html, style.css, firebase-config.js).
- New ‚ÄúImmigration‚Äù category with dedicated styling (index.html, admin.html, style.css, firebase-config.js).
- Expired/archiving UX with banners, grayscale styling, and ‚ÄúShow Expired‚Äù toggle (index.html, style.css, firebase-config.js).
- Manage Posts overhaul with search/sort/filter and edit/update workflow (admin.html, firebase-admin.js, style.css).

**Architecture**
- Frontend: Static HTML/CSS/JS, responsive design; deep‚Äëlinking to bulletins via URL hash.
- Backend: Firebase
  - Auth: Email/password restricted to `@ebhcs.org` accounts; privileged users for emergency overrides.
  - Firestore: `bulletins` collection with validated schema; real‚Äëtime snapshot subscriptions for instant UI updates.
  - Storage: Images/PDFs stored as data URLs or in Storage bucket per current configuration.
- Files of note: `index.html`, `admin.html`, `firebase-config.js`, `firebase-admin.js`, `enhanced-auth.js`, `style.css`.

**Security & Governance**
- Firestore Rules (see FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md, firestore.rules):
  - Public read for active bulletins only; write restricted to authenticated `@ebhcs.org` advisors.
  - Advisors can edit/delete only their own posts; admin/leah can manage all.
  - Strict data validation: required fields, category whitelist, size limits, immutable author/date.
- Authentication: Advisor accounts in Firebase Auth; first‚Äëlogin password change and support for reset.
- Recommended hardening (see Security Analysis.md):
  - HTML sanitization/XSS protection, CSP headers, rate limiting, file signature checks/virus scanning.

**Process & Rollout**
- Discovery: Advisors identified pain from posting the same item to multiple Google Classrooms; students missed content across silos.
- MVP: Public bulletin + simple Advisor Portal, using local storage for quick iteration.
- Production move: Firebase Auth/Firestore/Storage integration for secure multi‚Äëuser posting and real‚Äëtime updates.
- Iteration (advisor‚Äërequested): PDF uploads, Immigration category, expired system, filter overhaul, manage‚Äëposts redesign.
- Enablement: Advisor Guide with step‚Äëby‚Äëstep posting, best practices, and troubleshooting (ADVISOR_GUIDE.md).
- Handover: Director runbook for maintenance and user management (DIRECTOR_HANDOVER_GUIDE.md).

**Impact**
- Single source of truth for 350+ students across programs and classes.
- Reduced duplication and advisor workload by posting once centrally.
- Better student discovery via filters and calendar; easy mobile sharing per post.
- Cleaner lifecycle management: deadlines, expiration, and manage‚Äëposts tooling reduce stale items.

Note: If you track usage, consider measuring: number of posts/week, advisor adoption rate, unique student sessions, filter usage, average time to find a bulletin, expired‚Äëpost cleanup rate.

**Challenges & How We Addressed Them**
- Fragmented channels (multiple Classrooms): Replaced with a single public bulletin and deep‚Äëlinking for sharing.
- Posting friction: Simplified Advisor Portal with preview, required/recommended guidance, and form progress cues.
- Governance: Firestore rules enforce ownership; privileged accounts handle exceptions.
- Content lifecycle: Deadline/expired logic to prevent clutter while preserving visibility when needed.
- Security posture: Moved from local storage to Firebase; documented next‚Äëstep hardening for sanitization/CSP/rate limiting.

**What‚Äôs Next**
- Security hardening: Input sanitization, CSP, magic‚Äënumber checks, storage scanning; enable 2FA for privileged accounts.
- Analytics: Lightweight metrics for adoption and content effectiveness (e.g., views per post, filter usage).
- Advisor QoL: Drafts, scheduled posts, bulk edit/archiving, and optional notifications.
- Student UX: Saved filters, multilingual labels, and accessibility refinements informed by usage.

**How To Use**
- Students: Open `index.html` ‚Üí filter/search or switch to calendar view.
- Advisors: Open `admin.html` ‚Üí login ‚Üí create/manage posts. See ADVISOR_GUIDE.md for step‚Äëby‚Äëstep.

**Summary**
By consolidating announcements into one modern, filterable bulletin with secure advisor posting, EBHCS eliminated duplicate work across Google Classrooms and gave 350+ students a single, dependable place to find opportunities. The Firebase foundation enables safe growth, while the feature set reflects direct advisor feedback and real usage needs.
