# Advisor Bulletin Board - Deep Dive Bug Analysis

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL BUG #1: Date Fields Being Cleared**
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:**
The `toggleDateFields()` function was clearing all date input values every time it ran. When an advisor selected a date type and filled in dates, any subsequent call to this function would delete their input, causing form validation to fail.

**Location:** `firebase-admin.js` line 1549-1553

**Impact:**
- Advisors couldn't submit bulletins when they filled in the Event & Timing Details section
- Date information would mysteriously disappear
- Form validation would fail because required date fields became empty

**Fix:**
Removed the code that cleared date values. Now the function only manages visibility and the `required` attribute without deleting user input.

### ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL BUG #2: Double Save with Images**
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:**
When creating or updating a bulletin with an image, the bulletin was being saved **twice**:
1. Once inside `handleImageUpload()` (line 326)
2. Once at the end of `createBulletin()` (line 1327)

This resulted in:
- Duplicate bulletins being created when posting with images
- OR the second save overwriting the first, potentially losing the image

**Location:** `firebase-admin.js` lines 1316-1328, 1330-1347

**Impact:**
- Duplicate posts appearing in the bulletin board
- Inconsistent behavior between posts with and without images
- Potential data loss

**Fix:**
Modified both `createBulletin()` and `updateBulletin()` to only call `saveBulletin()` when there's NO image. When an image is present, `handleImageUpload()` handles the save operation.

### ðŸŸ¡ **BUG #3: eventTime Field Mismatch**
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:**
The code referenced a field called `eventTime` that doesn't exist in the HTML form. The actual form uses `startTime` and `endTime` fields instead.

**Location:**
- `firebase-admin.js` line 697 (editBulletin)
- `firebase-admin.js` line 1362 (buildBulletinObject)
- `firebase-admin.js` lines 856-860 (preview display)

**Impact:**
- When editing a bulletin, time information wouldn't populate
- JavaScript errors in browser console
- Time data not being saved correctly

**Fix:**
- Removed `eventTime` field from `buildBulletinObject()`
- Updated `editBulletin()` to populate `startTime`, `endTime`, and `eventLocation` fields
- Removed the eventTime display from preview (time is now shown via `renderPreviewDateInfo()`)

---

### ðŸŸ¡ **BUG #4: Close Button Selector Issue**
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:**
The code used `document.querySelector('.close')` which only selects the **first** close button on the page. Since there are 3 close buttons (login modal, forgot password modal, preview modal), only the first one would get an event listener attached.

**Location:** `firebase-admin.js` line 74

**Impact:**
- Close buttons on forgot password and preview modals wouldn't work
- Confusing user experience

**Fix:**
Changed to specifically target the login modal's close button: `document.querySelector('#loginModal .close')`

---

### ðŸŸ¡ **BUG #5: Missing Helper Methods**
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:**
The code called `formatDateLocal()` and `formatTimeRange()` methods that didn't exist in the class, causing errors when previewing bulletins with dates.

**Location:** `firebase-admin.js` lines 917, 919, 921, 926

**Impact:**
- Preview functionality would crash
- JavaScript errors when viewing bulletin previews
- Dates and times wouldn't display properly

**Fix:**
Added both missing methods:
- `formatDateLocal()`: Formats date strings in local timezone
- `formatTimeRange()`: Formats time ranges (e.g., "9:00 AM - 5:00 PM")

---

### ðŸŸ¡ **BUG #6: Edit Function Missing Time Fields**
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:**
When editing a bulletin, the `editBulletin()` function didn't populate the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `eventLocation` fields that exist in the form.

**Location:** `firebase-admin.js` line 697

**Impact:**
- When editing bulletins, time and location information wouldn't show up
- Advisors would have to re-enter time details when editing

**Fix:**
Added code to populate all three fields when editing:
```javascript
document.getElementById('startTime').value = bulletin.startTime || '';
document.getElementById('endTime').value = bulletin.endTime || '';
document.getElementById('eventLocation').value = bulletin.eventLocation || '';
```
